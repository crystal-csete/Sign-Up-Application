# Sign-Up-Application

This is a Sign up application. Using Mongodb whoever registers correctly, has their login credentials go to a database.

This was created using a create-react-app.

########################################

To get this app up and running, first you need to cd into the root of the directory. Then, cd into the main folder: "signup-front".

########################################

Then type: "npm install". Next, in a seperate terminal, repeat the above steps, but go one level deeper, cd into: "signup-backend". Then type: "npm install", to download dependencies.

########################################

Then type: "npm start" in each of your terminals. Make a .env file in the "signup-backend" folder. This will hold your secrets. In file "server.js", the variable DATABASE_URL is what this refers to. This variable will hold your Mongodb secrets that is in your .env file. This should get you up and running!

Happy coding!
